# BRIEF — multiagents repairs itself

**Phase: implement.** The review is done. `context/review/REPORT.md` has the
findings, the ledger has their state, and ~380 characterization tests are merged.
This phase turns the chosen findings into work.

`team: implement` is already set in `.multiagents/config/project.yaml`.

The review phase's brief is kept at
`context/review/BRIEF-review-phase.md` — read it for the two invariants
(providers are plugins, agy carries Gemini only), which still hold.

## What this project is

`multiagents` is an orchestration tool: a root orchestrator delegates to
specialist subagents, each in its own git worktree on its own branch, and the
parent merges what it accepts. Agents run inside one Docker container per
project, on an internal network whose only route out is a filtering proxy.

The thing that shapes every task here:

> **The codebase you are changing is multiagents itself.** You are running
> inside it. Your worktree is a checkout of the source that spawned you, merged
> your branch, and metered your tokens.

So a defect you fix is a defect in the machine you are standing on. That is why
phase 1 exists and why it comes first.

---

## Running the suite

```
uv run --frozen pytest
```

**Green is `949 passed, 1 failed, 3 skipped`** — measured 2026-09-17 from a
fresh worktree in the container with an agent's environment. The suite grew from
548 to 953 tests when the review's characterization work merged.

**The 1 failure is expected, and it is `F100`.**
`tests/test_c2_provider_harness.py::test_read_provider_caches_until_invalidated`
passes in isolation and fails in the full suite, because `budget._cache` is
keyed only by provider name and tests bleed state through it. It is scheduled as
phase 1 item 8. **Until that lands, one red test is the baseline, not a
regression you caused.** After it lands, green means green and the number is 953.

The 3 skips shell out to `docker`, deliberately absent in the container.

`REPORT.md` states the suite fails 17 tests in an agent container with
`PermissionError: can_spawn is false`. That did not reproduce on 2026-09-17 with
`MULTIAGENTS_CAN_SPAWN=false` set — one failure, not seventeen. Treat the 17 as
unconfirmed. If you see them, say so and say what your environment had that this
measurement did not.

Two traps that produce failures which are not defects:

- **Running from the project root on the host.** The root is bind-mounted into
  the container, so host and container share `.venv`, and `.venv/bin/pytest`
  carries a stale container-path shebang. A bare `uv run --frozen pytest` there
  runs a different pytest without `mcp` and reports 7 phantom failures. Use
  `uv run --frozen python -m pytest` in the project root. This does not reach
  you: your worktree has no `.venv` and `uv` builds you a clean one.
- **A bare `docker exec` is not an agent.** No git identity → 6 git tests fail.
  No forwarded PATH → `uv: not found`. Both are the harness.

**If a failure looks environmental, it probably is.** Check before filing.

## Phase 1 — repair the tool, before using it

**This is the whole first phase and nothing else starts until it lands.**

The review filed **7 blocking tickets** against multiagents itself. They are not
an upstream queue here — the user is the maintainer, and three of them actively
break the tool this team is running on. Fixing the allowlist while the container
is killing its own agents is work you will do twice.

Read each with `list_tickets`. **Every one carries a proposed fix and names the
test that should have caught it** — write that test, not merely a test.

| # | ticket | what it costs |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bug-cfdc71` | The workspace container has no PID 1 reaper. Fork-heavy work — running this suite, i.e. your normal job — leaves zombies until `pids_limit: 512` is exhausted. Measured: 509 processes, 505 zombies, then every agent dies with signal-shaped exits whose text blames Bun and innocent providers. Proposed fix: add `--init` to `run_args()`. **Do this one first.** |
| 2 | `bug-565863` | `budget_tag` enforcement and reporting sum raw usage keys instead of `token_count()`, which already exists and fixes exactly this elsewhere. Claude spend counts as zero. **This is why the review covered 2 of 7 contexts.** |
| 3 | `bug-08f9b3` | `harness` and `reporter` cannot revise their own output. `harness` omits `readonly_paths` where it needed `[]` — omission inherits the list rather than clearing it. A test encodes the bug by asserting the key is absent. |
| 4 | `bug-ad011c` | Steering a fallback-routed run rebuilds the command with the *preferred* provider's model and effort flag, killing the run. |
| 5 | `bug-97a0c7` | The documented recovery for a truncated run (`steer_agent`) fails with `Cwd must be an absolute path`, turning a truncated run into a permanent loss. |
| 6 | `bug-8195f2` | `wait_for_agents` reports a live, being-resumed agent as terminally `cancelled: "stopped by parent"`, because `steer()` reuses the user-facing `stop()` path. |
| 7 | `bug-e1cb10` | `budget_status` omits claude's short rolling window, reporting `severity: normal` and "all providers have headroom" while the quota guard sees minutes to empty. |
| 8 | **`F100`** | `budget._cache` keyed only by provider name; tests bleed state. The one live red test. Scheduled here because it is what makes the suite trustworthy for everyone after it. |

**Close each ticket with `resolve_ticket` when its fix merges.** A ticket whose
fix landed and which still reads `awaiting_user` will be refiled by the next
review.

## Phase 2 — the three rewrites

Accepted by the user, 2026-09-17, as rewrites rather than fixes. They are the
expensive decisions and they were taken deliberately rather than sliding past
inside a list.

All three live in `write_proxy_config`. Ten of the review's findings come from
one line: `host.replace(".", r"\.")` as the entire escaping strategy.

**1. Escape every ERE metacharacter** — `F13`, and with it `F1`, `F12`, `F14`.

Today only the literal dot is escaped. POSIX ERE alternation has the lowest
precedence of any operator, so an entry `evil.com|.*` produces a pattern
matching any host — `F1`, and it is critical. Unbalanced `(` or `[` produce an
invalid line that crashes tinyproxy's evaluation on every request — `F13`.

One change to a complete escape resolves all four. **Verify each id explicitly
against its own reproduction; do not assume three went green because the fourth
did.**

**2. Make the proxy suite load-bearing** — `F50`, and with it `F51`–`F54`.

`F50` is the review's most consequential finding: deleting one line,
`FilterDefaultDeny Yes`, inverts the proxy from allow-list to open relay, and
**all 48 characterization tests still pass**. The suite validates pattern
generation and never validates the directives that decide what those patterns
mean.

Rewrite the function and its suite together. The tests must assert
`FilterDefaultDeny Yes`, `FilterType ere`, `FilterCaseSensitive Off`,
`FilterURLs Off` and the `FilterFile` path are each present and correct.
`F51`–`F54` are the same work: each is a directive mutation nothing catches.

**3. Reject bare generic suffixes** — `F10`.

An entry like `com` acts as a wildcard across unrelated hosts, because the regex
anchors on `(^|\.)` and accepts any prefix. Separate from item 1 on purpose:
escaping metacharacters does not make `com` safe — the defect is the anchor, not
the escaping. Either validate each entry as a plausible hostname, or require a
dot-separated structure.

---

## Phase 3 — the rest of the six the report led with

**1. The cache that defends its own defect** — `F150`, `F122`, `F154`.

`F150` first, and as the opening move rather than a surprise:
`test_cache_hit_overwrites_spent_instead_of_merging_and_mutates_the_cached_object`
asserts the broken behaviour under a name that reads like a deliberate
invariant. Whoever fixes `F122` without knowing this sees a red test and
reverts. Delete or invert it, then fix `F122`, then pin `F154` — the correct
fresh-read merge is itself untested, so a fix matched against it leaves the
thing it was matched against undefended.

`F50` and `F150` together are the review's real lesson: a characterization suite
can fail in both directions, by not noticing a defect and by protecting one.

**2. Unreachable multi-account quota** — `F120`, critical and cheap.

`read_claude(config_dir=...)` exists to read per-account credential files, but
the builtin branch calls `builtin()` with no arguments and silently discards the
caller's `config_dir`. The `builtin is read_claude` identity check that causes it
is the same wart the review-phase brief flagged as where the fallback table leaks
into the dispatcher.

**3. `build_env` hands out the ambient environment** — `F112`, with `F33`.

`scripts.build_env` copies `dict(os.environ)` into every provider script call,
so a project-local script — which wins by precedence — receives the calling
process's live credentials. `F33` is the same shape in `base.build_env`: the
`blocked` list guards only the passthrough loop, so `BASE_ENV_KEYS` are
forwarded even when explicitly blocked.

**Treat `F33` at `F73`'s severity (medium/security), not its own
(low/correctness).** The review recorded that disagreement deliberately rather
than resolving it; forwarding a variable the configuration blocked is the
security reading, and that is the one to act on.

**4. Presence is not validity** — `F130`, `F131`, `F132`, `F140`.

All three shipped provider scripts and the Python `_claude_token` treat "the
file exists and I could not read a clock from it" as "authenticated". The runner
finds out when the agent's first turn 401s. One pattern, four sites, one change.

**`F131` overrides its author's proposed `accept`**, and that answers the report's
open question. The author's reasoning is that agy's token format may carry no
expiry — a claim about the format, so establish what the token actually contains.
If it genuinely has no expiry, the honest result is `cannot verify`, not
`authenticated`.

---

## What is NOT scheduled

**54 findings remain `open`. That is honest: nobody has decided about them yet**
— not "rejected", and not "unimportant". Do not treat the ledger's silence as
permission to skip them, and do not pick them up opportunistically either.

`list_findings` is the index. `read_finding(F12)` gets one. **Never open a
findings file to browse**: each holds every finding for a whole context, and
reading it to answer a question about one loads all of them.

Two are already `accepted` with reasons recorded — `F71` and `F73`, both
duplicates (of `F24` and `F33`). The report's "Defects in the review itself"
section resolves `F74` (withdrawn, never existed as a distinct defect) and
`F134` (a skipped number, nothing retracted).

## What the review did not cover

Not a criticism of the review — a statement of what is unknown, so nobody reads
a clean ledger as a clean codebase.

| context | state |
|---|---|
| C1 sandbox & egress | full review — 38 findings |
| C2 provider seam | full review; adversary hit `budget.py` only, 70 of 188 tests. **The seam and auth surfaces have never been attacked.** |
| C3 agent lifecycle | harness merged and proven, 7 green proof tests. **No characterization, no audit, no adversary, no findings.** `runner.py` is 61% covered with 435 uncovered statements — the largest block of untested logic in the codebase. |
| C4–C7 | mapped and ranked, never started. C5 (MCP server) has the lowest coverage at 36%. |

Both gaps were caused by `bug-565863`, not by the work being too large. Fixing it
in phase 1 is what makes finishing the review affordable.

## Housekeeping

Eleven agent worktrees from the review are still on disk with unmerged branches
(`git worktree list`). One is named in the report: `agents/reporter/15f9e7`
carries a REPORT.md amendment reverted by `bug-08f9b3`. **Check it before
deleting anything** — the rest are spent, but that one holds work.

---

## Where things are

- `context/review/REPORT.md` — the review. **The index; read it first.**
- `context/review/MAP.md` — the seven contexts, ranked with measurements.
- `context/review/ledger.yaml` — finding state. Prefer `list_findings`.
- `context/review/BRIEF-review-phase.md` — the review phase's brief. The two
  invariants in it still hold.
- `docs/open-questions.md` — what this project believes, with the evidence and
  how to check it. **Read the entries for your area before filing anything**;
  several were wrong the first time and the corrections are recorded in place.
- `README.md` — 153 KB of reference manual. Send `researcher` at it.

## This project does not specify before it builds

No `context/specs/`. Requirements are expressed as tests, as findings, and as
`docs/open-questions.md`. The interface contract for each phase is the
orchestrator's to write.
